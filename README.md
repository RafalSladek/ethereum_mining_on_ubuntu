# Mining Ethereum on Ubuntu

These are some walkthroughs to configure your AMD GPUs to mine with Ubuntu. I prefer Ubuntu because you do not have to pay unneccessary license fees to microsoft and it is more flexible and reliable once you have it running. Getting it to run could be a hazzle and that's why i wrote down this walkthroighs to mine coins with Ubuntu.

So here are the guides:
- Install [Ubuntu 14.04](ubuntu_14.04.md) (recommended) or [Ubuntu 15.04](ubuntu_15.04.md)
- Install and run [Ethereum mining software](ethereum_mining.md)
- Alternatively you could also [mine SIACoins](sia_mining.md), which is sometimes more profitable.

I am by no means an expert on mining, Ubuntu or anything else. I am just a guy who copy and pasted all the guides which worked for me together in one place. But if you have anything to add or find any mistakes, please commit via git or just write an email to [gerald@baeck.at](mailto:gerald@baeck.at).
